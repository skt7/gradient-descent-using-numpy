#Gradient Descent Using Numpy
main.py contains the main algorithm of the gradient descent. 

#Implementation
I have tried to do it in both ways, the iterative process (fit function) and normal equation(_fit function)
 
#Comparision with sckit-learn's 'linear_model.LinearRegression()'
In the last section I have shown the comparision between scikit-learn's and my own implementation(normal equation one - _fit) the results are same as well as the learned weights
